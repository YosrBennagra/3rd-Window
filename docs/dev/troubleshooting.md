# Troubleshooting (Draft)

- Blank window: ensure Vite is running on port 5173 (Tauri dev server). Restart `npm run tauri:dev` if the port was busy.
- Metrics missing: ensure sensors/tools available; verify permissions.
- Tauri build issues: confirm Rust toolchain installed and up to date (`rustup update`).
