# Personas

## Power User (Dev/Creator)
- Needs live system metrics, notifications, and notes always visible.
- Pain: alt-tabbing breaks flow; monitoring tools are noisy.

## Gamer/Streamer
- Needs temps, FPS overlay alternatives, network stability indicators, alerts for overheating.
- Pain: overlays clutter main screen; wants side monitor dashboard.

## Ops/SRE Lite
- Needs prioritized alerts (warning/critical), quiet hours, webhook actions.
- Pain: generic toasts lack severity and routing.
